## Image Gallery App

This is a react native image gallery demo app. To get started please add a `config.js` file to the root directory and add the following configuration object to it

```javascript
  export default {
    PIXABAY_API_KEY: /* YOUR PIXABAY API KEY */
  }
```

After that just type `npm start` into your terminal and you will be able to run it like any other react native app.
