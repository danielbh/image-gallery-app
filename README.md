## Image Gallery App.

This is a react native image gallery demo app. To get started please add a `config.js` file to the root directory and add the following configuration object to it

export default {
  PIXABAY_API_KEY: [YOUR PIXABAY KEY]
}

After that just type `npm start` and you will be able to run it like any other react native app.
